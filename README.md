# clj-zipkin

Zipkin tracing instrumentation for Clojure applications.

## Usage

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

       [clj-zipkin "0.1.2"]

### Tracing

Tracing a code chunk 

```clojure

(:require [clj-zipkin.tracer :as t])

(t/trace {:host "10.2.1.2" :span "GET" :scribe {:host "zipkin.host" :port 9410}}
         (..code..))

```

Nested tracing, scribe config can be avoided for inner tracing. This will make inner traces
 appear in zipkin as childs of the immediate parent trace.

```clojure

(:require [clj-zipkin.tracer :as t)

(t/trace {:host "10.2.1.2" :span "GET" :scribe {:host "zipkin.host" :port 9410}}
         (..code..)
         (t/trace {:host "10.2.1.2" :span "OTHER"}
                  (..code..)))

```

Tracing with a specific `trace-id`, since all related spans in zipkin should share the
same `trace-id`, if your code is executing in different hosts you can tie your traces
together specifying the `trace-id` to use.

```clojure

(:require [clj-zipkin.tracer :as t)

(t/trace {:host "10.2.1.2" :span "GET" :trace-id 12345 :scribe {:host "zipkin.host" :port 9410}}
         (..code..)
         (t/trace {:host "10.2.1.2" :span "OTHER"}
                  (..code..)))

```

#### Parameters

Tracing parameters

```
  :host => current host, defaults to InetAddress/getLocalHost if unspecified
  :span => span name
  :trace-id => optional, new one will be created if unspecified
  :span-id => optional, current span-id, useful to append annotations or to keep track of created id
  :parent-span-id => optional, parent span-id, this span will be nested
  :scribe => scribe/zipkin endpoint configuration {:host h :port p}
```

The `host` parameter can also be a structured hash-map

```clojure
   {:host "10.2.1.1" :port 3030 :service "Service Name"}
```

If not specified will default to port `0` and service `Unknown Service`.

### Ring Handler

A ring handler is available for automated tracing of incoming requests

```clojure
   (require '[clj-zipkin.middleware :as m])
  
   (defroutes routes
     (GET "/" [] "<h1>Hello World</h1>")
     (route/not-found "<h1>Page not found</h1>"))

   (def app
       (-> routes
       (m/request-tracer {:scribe {:host "localhost" :port 9410}
                          :service "WebServer"})))
   
```

Configuration received by the tracer handler is almost the same as the `trace` function defined above, so it also supports a `host` parameter.

```clojure
(m/request-tracer {:scribe {:host "localhost" :port 9410}
                   :host {:port 2020 :service "MyService"}}))
```

If no `ip` is specified will default to `java.net.InetAddress/getLocalHost`

##Example

There's a small running example [here](examples/server.clj) showing how to chain different spans in a web server.

This is how it looks that example in zipkin:

##TODO

* Binary Annotations
* Dynamic Annotations support in the API
* Change span annotations default text?
